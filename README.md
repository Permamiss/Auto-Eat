# Auto-Eat
This mod was made out of a personal desire to be able to focus more on playing the game than managing it. Having to pay constant attention to my Energy was a pain in the butt for me, so I decided to create this Quality-of-Life mod a while back. I have been keeping it up to date on the Nexus, and it now includes the ability to set the threshold at which your character eats, in the event that you have other mods that do things based off your Energy. This can be set in the mod's auto-generated config file.

Requires SMAPI to use.
